## SimplerEnv Evaluation for MAGMA

To faciliate the quantitative evaluation of our model, we also provide a model class for [SimplerEnv](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv).

After installing SimplerEnv, copy './simpler_env' to the corresponding folder under 'SimplerEnv/simpler_env' folder. Make sure the hiarchy is the same as original one.
