        base_img_size (int, *optional*, defaults to 768):
            as convnext has 1/32 downsample rate, we use 768 as the base resolution so that the resulted feature map is 24x24.

            number of effective crops when coping with images with higher resolution than 768x768. note that num_crops > 1 does not mean we are cropping the image.
