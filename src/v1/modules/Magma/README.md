## What is Magma?

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/magma_intro_fig.png?raw=true" width="50%">
</div>

**Magma is a foundation model for multimodal AI agents**. As the bedrock for multimodal agentic models, it should possess strong capabilities to perceive the multimodal world AND takes goal-driven actions precisely (see above figure). With this in mind, we are striving for the following goals:

* **Verbal and spatial-temporal intelligence:** Magma is supposed to have both strong verbal and spatial-temporal intelligence to understand images and videos, ground its actions on the observations, and further translate the external goal into action plan and executions.
* **Digital and physical world:** Magma should not be limited to either the digital world (e.g., web navigation) or the physical world (e.g., robotics manipulation), but rather be able to work across both worlds, just like humans ourselves.

With this in mind, we developed a new pretraining data, which mostly consists of unlabeled videos in the wild plus the existing annotated agentic data, and a new pretraining framework, which unifies the training of all three modalities (text, image, and action), to train a new foundation model for multimodal AI agents, named Magma.

## How we pretrain Magma?

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/magma_pt_v3.png?raw=true" width="100%">
</div>

We pursue the goal through two dimensions:

* **Large-scale heterogeneous training data**: we curate a large amount of data in the wild, including existing multimodal understanding data, UI navigation data, and robotics manipulation data, and unlabeled videos in the wild. We also propose a new data collection pipeline to collect unlabeled videos in the wild, which is scalable and cost-effective. To attain useful action supervision from raw videos and robotics trajectories, we meticulously removed the camera motions in the videos and then transform the motions into "action" supervisions for our model training. These provide unique signals for the model to learn the cross-modal connections and long-horizon action prediction and planning.

* **Universal pretraining objectives**: texts and actions are inherently different and thus cause a huge gap, while visual tokens are continuous. We propose a universal pretraining framework that unifies the training of all three modalities, and we show that this is crucial for the model to learn the cross-modal connections. More specifically, we proposed Set-of-Mark and Trace-of-Mark as the auxiliary tasks for our model pretraining, as the bridge of different output modalities. In this way, we are building a great alignment between the text and action modalities, and also between the image and action modalities.

pip install -e .
```

3. Install packages for training:

```bash
pip install -e ".[train]"
```

4. Install packages for agents:

```bash
pip install -e ".[agent]"
```

5. Other probably needed packages:

* Co-tracker

# Install co-tracker
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/co-tracker
cd co-tracker
pip install -e .
pip install imageio[ffmpeg]
cd ../
```

* Kmeans

‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure you have installed the transformers with correct version (>=4.49.0). If you see some abnormal behavior, please check the version of transformers, and probably see below for the customized transformers.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

### Customized Transformers

‚ö†Ô∏è One important thing to note is that our model uses [ConvNext](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/convnext.py) as the backbone, which contains a layer scaler parameter [gamma](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/e44f14d7d2f557b9f3add82ee4f1ed2beefbb30d/timm/models/convnext.py#L144). This leads to a bug of Transformers library as it automatically replace the 'gamma' with 'weight' when loading the model. To fix this, we need to modify the 'transformers/models/auto/modeling_auto.py' file as follows:

```python 
if "gamma" in key and "clip_vision_model" not in key:
    key = key.replace("gamma", "weight")
```
This bug still exists in the latest transformer version. So please make sure you install the following bug-free customized version of transformers as lised in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jwyang/transformers.git@dev/jwyang-v4.44.1
```

or the newest version:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jwyang/transformers.git@dev/jwyang-v4.48.2
```

</details>

## Data Preprocessing

### SoM and ToM Generation

As shown in Table 1 of our paper, we apply SoM and ToM on both robotics data and instructional videos. To ensure reproducibility, we provide the code to generate SoM and ToM for instructional videos. The code is located in `tools/som_tom/demo.py`. You can run the following command to generate SoM and ToM for the robotics data:

```bash
python tools/som_tom/demo.py
```

And then you can find two videos in the `tools/som_tom/videos` folder. The original trace extracted from CoTracker is shown in `orig_trace.mp4`, and the SoM-ToM video is named `som_tom.mp4`.

## Model Training

We provide the instructions to pretrain LLama-3-8B-Instruct on Open-X-Embodiment and finetune Magma-8B on different downstream tasks.

### Pretraining on Open-X without SoM/ToM

* Data Preparation

Download Open-X-Embodiment from the official site. Then edit the data config file [openx.yaml](data_configs/openx.yaml) accordingly. The data config file should look like this:

```yaml
# a list of all the data paths
DATA_PATH: 
  - "/path/to/open-x"
IMAGE_FOLDER:
  - "siglip-224px+mx-oxe-magic-soup"    
LANGUAGE_PATH:
  - ""
```

* Pretrain on OpenX

Once set up the dataset and config, you can run the following command to finetune the model:

```bash
sh scripts/pretrain/pretrain_openx.sh
```
* Benefit: We spent tremendous effort to decouple the Open-X dataloader from OpenVLA and make it compatible with other datasets used in our experiments*

### Finetuning on Magma-820K

* Data Preparation

Download annotation file from [MagmaAI/Magma-820K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MagmaAI/Magma-820K). Please prepare the image data according to the dataset list in the dataset page. Once finished, please edit [magma_820k.yaml](data_configs/magma_820k.yaml) file accordingly.

```yaml
# a list of all the data paths
DATA_PATH: 
  - "/path/to/magma_820k.json"
IMAGE_FOLDER:
  - "/root/to/magma_820k/images"
```

* Finetune from Magma-8B

Once set up the dataset and config, you can run the following command to finetune the model:

```bash
sh scripts/finetune/finetune_magma_820k.sh
```

## Model Usage

### Inference

#### Inference with Huggingface Transformers

We have uploaded the model to Huggingface Hub. You can easily load the model and processor with the following code.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```python
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoProcessor 

dtype = torch.bfloat16
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/Magma-8B", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=dtype)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/Magma-8B", trust_remote_code=True)

convs = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are agent that can see, talk and act."},            
    {"role": "user", "content": "<image_start><image><image_end>\nWhat is the letter on the robot?"},
]
prompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convs, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
inputs = processor(images=[image], texts=prompt, return_tensors="pt")
inputs['pixel_values'] = inputs['pixel_values'].unsqueeze(0)
inputs['image_sizes'] = inputs['image_sizes'].unsqueeze(0)
inputs = inputs.to("cuda").to(dtype)

    "temperature": 0.0, 
    "do_sample": False, 
    "use_cache": True,
    "num_beams": 1,
} 

with torch.inference_mode():
    generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, **generation_args)

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1] :]
response = processor.decode(generate_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True).strip()

print(response)
```
</details>

#### Inference with local Transformers code from this repo

If you want to debug our model, we also provide a local code for inference. You can run the following code to load the model.
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```python
from magma.processing_magma import MagmaProcessor
from magma.modeling_magma import MagmaForCausalLM

dtype = torch.bfloat16

processor = MagmaProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/Magma-8B", trust_remote_code=True)
model.to("cuda")
```
</details>

#### Inference with bitsandbytes

We also provide a sample code to inference with bitsandbytes. You can run the following code to load the model.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

```python
from PIL import Image
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoProcessor 
from transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig

# Define quantization configuration
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"
)

# Load model with quantization config
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "microsoft/Magma-8B", 
    trust_remote_code=True,
    device_map={"": 0},  # force everything onto GPU 0
    quantization_config=quantization_config
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/Magma-8B", trust_remote_code=True)

# Inference
image = Image.open("assets/images/magma_logo.jpg").convert("RGB")

convs = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are agent that can see, talk and act."},            
    {"role": "user", "content": "<image_start><image><image_end>\nWhat is the letter on the robot?"},
]
prompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convs, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
inputs = processor(images=[image], texts=prompt, return_tensors="pt")
inputs['pixel_values'] = inputs['pixel_values'].unsqueeze(0)
inputs['image_sizes'] = inputs['image_sizes'].unsqueeze(0)

# Convert inputs to the correct device and data type
inputs = {k: v.to(device=model.device, dtype=torch.float16 if v.dtype == torch.float32 else v.dtype) 
          for k, v in inputs.items()}

generation_args = { 
    "max_new_tokens": 500, 
    "temperature": 0.0, 
    "do_sample": False, 
    "use_cache": True,
    "num_beams": 1,
} 

with torch.inference_mode():
    generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, **generation_args)

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1] :]
response = processor.decode(generate_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True).strip()
print(response)
```
</details>

#### Benchmarking

We benchmark the inference time and memory usage of our model with and without bitsandbytes.

| Model | Inference Time | Peak Memory Usage |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| Magma-8B (bfloat16) | 1.1s | 17GB |
| Magma-8B (4-bit) | 1.1s | 7GB |

### Evaluation with lmms-eval

Please refer to [lmms-eval-instruction](tools/lmms-eval-magma) for the detailed instructions to run the evaluation with lmms-eval toolkit.

Once everything is ready, you can run the following code to evaluate our model from the root folder.

```bash
sh scripts/evaluation/lmms-eval/lmms_eval_magma.sh
```

You can evaluate other benchmarks by modifying the variable, eval_tasks. The list of `eval_tasks` can be found after running below code.
```
# lmms-eval --tasks {list_groups,list_subtasks,list_tags,list}
lmms-eval --tasks list_groups
```

### Evaluation with SimplerEnv

Please refer to [SimplerEnv-instruction](tools/simplerenv-magma) for the detailed instructions to run the evaluation with SimplerEnv toolkit.

Once everything is ready, you can run the following code to evaluate our model.

```bash
sh scripts/evaluation/simplerenv/bridge.sh
```

### Multi-images or Video Support

Handle multiple images is extremely simple for our model. You just simply duplicate the placeholder in your text prompt, and correspondingly add all images into the list. A dummy example is as follows:

```py
convs = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are agent that can see, talk and act."},            
    {"role": "user", "content": "<image_start><image><image_end>\n<image_start><image><image_end>\n<image_start><image><image_end>\nWhat is the letter on the robot?"},
]
prompt = processor.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convs, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
inputs = processor(images=[image1,image2,image3], texts=prompt, return_tensors="pt")
```
Our model will handle the visual token filling for you!

### API Server

We provide a FastAPI server for deploying Magma as a REST API service, which enables:
- Vision and language processing via REST endpoints
- Action prediction for robotics applications
- Support for both base64-encoded images and file uploads

The server can be deployed in three ways:
1. **Run directly**: Simplest option for development
2. **Docker container**: Recommended for production
3. **Native system service**: For system integration

#### Quick Start

```bash
cd server
./magma-server.sh run
```

This will set up a conda environment, install dependencies, and start the server on port 8080.

#### Docker Deployment

```bash
cd server
./magma-server.sh docker up
```

#### API Endpoints

The API exposes the following endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Check if the server is running and model is loaded
- `POST /predict` - Predict using base64-encoded image
- `POST /predict_from_file` - Predict using uploaded image file

For more details, see the [Server README](server/README.md).

### Agent Demos

#### UI Agent

We built agent models for our model. The first one we built is UI Agent Demo. As our model is pretrained with Set-of-Mark and Trace-of-Mark, it is naturally synergic to [OmniParser](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser). Combining them together, you can immediately get an UI agent, run:

```bash
python agents/ui_agent/app.py
```

More importantly, as our Magma model not only has the action-grounding ability, but also multimodal understanding and reasoning ability. You can not only ask the model predict where to click with text:

```bash
Go to the top ranked post
```

But also ask free question on the fly! Simply add a prefix "Q:" at the beginning of text prompt, e.g.,

```bash
Q: What is the title of the post?
```

#### Gaming Agent

We also built a gaming agent demo. You can run the following command to start the demo:

```bash
python agents/gaming_agent/app.py
```

Once the demo is run, you can see a robot proactively collecting the green blocks.

For this demo, you may encounter an error as discussed in this [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Magma/issues/43), a quick fix is running the following command:

```sh
pip install imageio[ffmpeg]
```

If it still does not work, please install the older version of transformers:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/jwyang/transformers.git@dev/jwyang-v4.44.1
```

## User Guidance

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->
### Direct use

This model is intended for broad research use in English. The model take images and text as inputs, and produces the textual outputs for the following uses:

* **Image/Video-Conditioned Text Generation:** The model can generate text (e.g., descriptions, answers) based on the input text and image.

* **Visual Planning Capabilities:** The model can also produce the visual trace as the future planning to accomplish a task (e.g., move object from one place to another).

* **Agentic Capabilities:** The model can also generate UI grounding (e.g., click ``search'' button) and robotics manipulations (e.g., 7 DoF for the robot gripper).

Our model is designed only for research purpose and aimed at knowledge-sharing and accelerating research in multimodal AI, in particularly the mutimodal agentic AI.

### Downstream Use

The model can be further finetuned for different downstream tasks, such as:

* **Image Captioning and QA:** We can further finetune this model for image captioning and QA tasks under the pipeline of multimodal LLMs. Based on our experiments, the model can achieve competitive performance yet better spatial understanding and reasoning on these tasks.

* **Video Captioning and QA:** We can further finetune this model for video captioning and QA tasks under the pipeline of multimodal LLMs. Based on our experiments, the model can achieve competitive performance yet better temporal understanding and reasoning on these tasks.

* **UI Navigation:** We can finetune this model for specific UI navigation tasks, such as web navigation or mobile navigation. The model can achieve superior performance on these tasks.

* **Robotics Manipulation:** Our model can be further finetuned for robotics tasks given its general agentic capabilities as a vision-language-action model. After finetuning, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as OpenVLA on robotics manipulation tasks.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Please note that this model is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios.
